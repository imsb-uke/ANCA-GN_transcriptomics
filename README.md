**Data preparation**
1. Place the cellranger- and spaceranger-aligned data in folder ```data```. For ther versions used in the manuscript, please refer to the methods section of the manuscript.
2. Place the TIF files corresponding to each spatial sample in the folder ```tif_processed```

Guided code for required to reproduce the results is available in the folder ```notebooks```. The second step of the processing is too big to push to GitHub, this can be downloaded from [02_cluster.ipynb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11mMGel0VzCgbqmvUIG5L2zHP9qBJGoqu/view?usp=sharing)

The folders ```annotations_visium*``` contain expert-annotations of the Visium samples
